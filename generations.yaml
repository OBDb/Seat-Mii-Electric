    description: "The SEAT Mii Electric was not a new vehicle design but rather an all-electric version of the existing SEAT Mii city car, which had been available with gasoline engines since 2011. When SEAT discontinued all internal combustion engine versions of the Mii in 2019, the Electric variant became the sole offering, marking SEAT's first all-electric production vehicle. Built on the Volkswagen Group's NSF (New Small Family) platform shared with the Volkswagen e-up! and Å koda Citigo-e iV, the Mii Electric maintained the standard Mii's compact dimensions at just 3.56 meters long, making it ideal for urban environments. Propulsion came from an 82 horsepower (61 kW) electric motor producing 156 lb-ft (212 Nm) of torque, powered by a 36.8 kWh lithium-ion battery pack providing a WLTP-rated range of up to 161 miles (260 km). Performance was modest but adequate for its city car positioning, with 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) acceleration in approximately 12.3 seconds and a top speed limited to 80 mph (130 km/h). Charging capabilities included AC charging at up to 7.2 kW (allowing a full charge in about 4 hours) and DC fast charging at up to 40 kW (providing 0-80% charge in approximately one hour). The exterior design was nearly identical to the gasoline-powered Mii, with minor changes including 'Electric' badging, unique 16-inch alloy wheels, and slightly revised front-end styling. The interior similarly maintained the gasoline Mii's straightforward design but featured specific electric vehicle instrumentation, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear knob, heated seats, and a unique dashboard finish. Standard equipment was generous compared to the previous gasoline models, with all Mii Electric versions featuring air conditioning, lane assist, traffic sign recognition, rear parking sensors, and a smartphone integration system that allowed a mounted smartphone to serve as the primary infotainment display. The Mii Electric was positioned as an affordable entry point into electric mobility, significantly undercutting many competitors on price while offering practical urban transportation with zero emissions. Production ended in 2021 without a direct replacement, as SEAT shifted focus to larger electric vehicles developed on dedicated EV platforms."
